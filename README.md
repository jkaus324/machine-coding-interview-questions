# Machine-coding-interview-questions platform
### The LLD interview gap nobody talks about — and the repo that fixes it.

---

> 🚀 **Ready for the full thing?** **[Crack LLD Interviews: Book + Practice Platform →](https://topmate.io/jatin_kaushal24/2203994)** pairs both halves: the **Design Patterns Handbook** (16 chapters that make you *feel* the problem before naming the pattern) and **DSA-Meet-Design/Pro** — **105 machine coding + LLD problems** with dual-view editorials, 9 company tracks and a 6-week playbook. **₹1,199 together vs ₹1,398 apart.** This pilot has **20** of the problems.

> *"He could solve any LeetCode hard. He had no idea what hit him when the interviewer asked him to make his solution extensible."*

> That's a real Amazon LLD round. That candidate was prepared — just not for this.

## What's the gap?

Product companies at the 1–3 year level don't just test algorithms anymore. They give you a real-world scenario, ask you to design it, then add requirements mid-interview to see if your design *survives*.

Most people fail not because they can't code — but because nobody ever taught them **how DSA lives inside good design**, and what it looks like when it breaks.

There's no LeetCode for this. GitHub repos are static code dumps. YouTube is passive. Codezym is Java-only.

This repo is different.

---

## How it works

Each problem is structured exactly like a real LLD interview round:

```
Part 1  →  Base requirement (you solve it)
Part 2  →  Extension 1 unlocks only after Part 1 tests pass
Part 3  →  Extension 2 unlocks only after Part 2 tests pass
```

No honor system. You earn the next part.

When a new part unlocks, your design either survives the new requirement — or exposes exactly why it doesn't. That's the learning.

---

## The local dashboard

Clone the repo, run two commands, and you get a LeetCode-style interface on your machine:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# → opens at http://localhost:5173
```

From the dashboard you can:
- Browse all problems by tier, pattern, and company
- Pick your difficulty mode per problem (Learning / Guided / Interview)
- Write C++, Go, Java, Python, or JavaScript directly in the browser editor
- Run tests locally and see pass/fail output inline
- Read Design Pattern Primers before attempting problems
- Track your progress across sessions

---

## Three difficulty modes — same problem, different starting point

| Mode | What you get | Who it's for |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Interview** | Blank slate — just the problem statement and data types | You know the pattern, you want real practice |
| **Guided** | Key interfaces defined, `// HINT:` comments on purpose — no pattern names | You're learning but want to think |
| **Learning** | Full class structure, `// TODO:` inside method bodies only | You want to understand before you try |

You can switch modes at any point. Most people start in Learning, attempt Guided, then test themselves in Interview mode before their actual interview.

## Design Pattern Primers

Before you attempt a problem, read the primer for its pattern. These aren't Wikipedia entries — they're written specifically for interview context: what the pattern is, why it fits certain problems, what breaks without it, and C++ examples you can reason about.

Primers available: **Strategy · Observer · State · Singleton**

Problems are solvable in **C++, Go, Java, Python, and JavaScript** — every language runs
against the same language-agnostic test cases.

---

## Prerequisites

Node.js 18+ is required to run the dashboard. Beyond that, install only the language(s)
you want to solve in — the dashboard auto-detects which runners are available and disables
submit for the ones that aren't (you can still browse and write code).

- **Node.js 18+** — required (dashboard + JavaScript runner)
- **g++** with C++17 support (`g++ --version`) — for C++
- **Go 1.21+** (`go version`) — for Go
- **JDK 17+** (`javac -version`) — for Java
- **Python 3** (`python3 --version`) — for Python

All five languages run through a single spec-driven test harness — see the architecture note below.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jkaus324/machine-coding-interview-questions.git
cd machine-coding-interview-questions

# Install dashboard dependencies
cd dashboard && npm install && cd ..

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Dashboard → `http://localhost:5173`  
API server → `http://localhost:3000`

### Architecture — one spec, five languages

Every problem is defined once in **`spec.yaml`** (its data types, function signatures, and
progressive parts) plus **`tests/cases/partN.yaml`** (language-agnostic test cases). Each language
has a single generic runner under `harness/<lang>/` — there are no per-problem, per-language test
files to maintain. Interpreted languages (Python, JavaScript, Java) read the spec and cases at
submit time; compiled languages (C++, Go) generate a small runner that is compiled alongside your
solution. **Adding a language is harness-only work** — write one runner + one boilerplate emitter,
and all problems light up in that language.

Verify everything locally:

```bash
python3 scripts/stress_test.py            # all problems × all languages
python3 scripts/stress_test.py --lang go  # just one language
```

---

## Running the E2E suite

The `e2e/` folder contains plain-English user stories an LLM-driven browser agent (Playwright MCP) can execute against the running dashboard. Useful before tagging a release or after a UI change:

```bash
# Start the dashboard with an isolated progress file (won't touch your real progress)
pwsh scripts/e2e-up.ps1 -Detach        # Windows
./scripts/e2e-up.sh --detach           # macOS/Linux

# Then in a Claude Code session, ask the agent:
#   Run e2e/stories/_smoke.md against http://localhost:3000.
```

See `e2e/README.md` for the full suite, priorities, and authoring guide.

## Who this is for

**Primary:** Developers with 1–3 years experience at service companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant) preparing to switch to product companies — Amazon, Flipkart, Razorpay, Meesho, PhonePe, Paytm, Groww.

You've done DSA. You haven't done LLD. This is the missing piece.

**Secondary:** Indian developers targeting Canadian product companies (Shopify, Wealthsimple, Coveo). The machine-coding format you've been practicing is the wrong format for Canadian interviews. This repo covers both.

---

## This is a pilot

20 problems. Real test suites. A working dashboard. Enough to get meaningful feedback before the full launch.

If you find a bug, open an issue. If a DESIGN.md explanation didn't click, open an issue and say what was confusing. That feedback directly shapes what gets built next.

---

## Want the full library?

Reading builds recognition. Doing builds the reflex. You need both, so they're sold together:
**[Crack LLD Interviews: Book + Practice Platform](https://topmate.io/jatin_kaushal24/2203994)** —
**₹1,199** for the pack, versus **₹1,398** buying the two halves separately.

### 📖 Part 1 — The Design Patterns Handbook

16 chapters: one on foundational principles, then 15 patterns. Every chapter drops you into a
real company with a small ticket and piles on requirements until your clean code curdles — so
you feel the problem *before* it names the pattern you just reinvented. No `Shape → Circle`
examples you'll never see again.

This is the long-form version of the four primers in this repo.

### ⚙️ Part 2 — DSA-Meet-Design/Pro (CodeJunction)

The 105-problem library this pilot is a slice of, pulled from real interviews at Amazon,
Flipkart, Razorpay, PhonePe, Meesho, Swiggy, Uber, Ola, Microsoft, and Google.

- **5x more problems** than this pilot, tagged by company and difficulty
- **Dual-view editorials** for every problem — LLD perspective + machine-coding perspective + the *Junction* analysis (where one wrong design choice in minute 5 kills the algorithm in minute 25)
- **9 company-specific tracks** with curated problem sequences in interview order
- **6-week prep playbook** with a structured weekly cadence
- **10 design pattern primers** (vs 4 in the pilot)
- Solutions in **C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript**
- Cheat sheets and AI review prompts you can paste straight into Claude/ChatGPT
- The same local dashboard you're already running

**Get both → [Crack LLD Interviews on Topmate](https://topmate.io/jatin_kaushal24/2203994)** · ₹1,199 · GitHub access within 10 minutes of payment.
